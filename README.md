# r_versus_python_iris_eda_example
This repository presents two reports on the same topic, and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris flower data set, one done in R and the other one in Python.

The repository's purpose is to compare and contrast two possible ways of doing one unique project, the R way, and the Python way. The idea is to have a first-hand experience with each tool performing the same projects' tasks. This way one can learn the similarities and differences of each statistical software/programming language doing the same task.

Each report is identically organized into five parts:

Introduction
Loading libraries and data set
Exploratory Data Analysis 3.1 Tables 3.2 Visualizations
Correlation analysis
Conclusion
A judgment on minimal tables and visualizations that an EDA on this topic should have is done, also, a correlation analysis is done, which may be or not part of an EDA.

The tables are:

Data set view
Data set Structure / Information
Response view
Missing values
Data set summary
Response view summary
Correlation matrix
And the visualizations are:

Histograms
Bar plots / Distribution plots
Box plots
Violin plots
Density plots (Kernel Density Estimator)
Scatter plots / Relational plots
Pair plots
Correlation plots
Concerning libraries/packages, base / built-in functions are utilized in prevalence, unless there is no known function to perform a task, most popular libraries/packages functions are utilized. The libraries/packages utilized, according to each statistical software/programming language, are:

R

tidyverse
ggcorrplot
Python

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
The two main files in these repositories are the one in R (.R) and the one in Python (.ipynb).
